Following assumptions are made about the IIT Course management :

1. Four Departments : A, B, C, D
2. Two Degrees : B_TECH = 1, DUAL = 2
3. Two Semesters : Autumn = 1, Spring = 2


Rules for using IDs :

0. DeanID : "D",  password : "D"

1. CourseID : Semester(1/2) + Deptt.(A/B/C/D) + CourseNumber(serial number)
	ex- 6th course in autumn sem in deptt A has courseID : 1A6

2. StudentID or Roll Number : Year(12,13...) + Deptt.(A/B/C/D) + Degree(1/2) + serial number
	password(default) : "student"(can be changed)
	ex- Roll Number/ StudentID of 7th student registered in 2012 in deptt A in B.Tech is 12A17
	ex- Roll Number/ StudentID of 4th student registered in 2013 in deptt C in Dual is 13C24
	
3. Faculty Advisor(FacAdID) : "F" + Deptt.(A/B/C/D) + Batch Year(1/2/3/4/5)
	password(default) : "facad"(can be changed)
	ex- 4th year in deptt C has faculty advisor FC4
	 
4. TeacherID(Non-Faculty Advisor) : "T" + Deptt.(A/B/C/D) + serial number
	password(default) : "teacher"(can be changed)
	ex-9th Non-Faculty Advisor teacher in deptt D is TD9
	 	
5. DegID : Year(1/2/3/4/5) + Deptt(A/B/C/D) + Degree(1/2)
	ex-DegID of 3rd year, deptt A, degree B.Tech is 3A1
	ex-DegID of 1st year, deptt D, degree B.Tech is 1D1
   Importance : Each DegID has same CORE courses and same ELECTIVE courses offered, set by the Dean as the first Operation in each semester 	
	

Initial semester : Autumn 2012
Note : 
1. Semester changes to Spring 2013, then to Autumn 2013 and so on
2. Random data is provided for courses(modifiable), students(optional and modifiable), teachers, and faculty advisors


SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS :

1. First, Dean enters the course details
   UserID : "D"
   Password : "D"
   By default, 35 courses are assumed for each semester
   --Course Details like name, LTPC can be changed
   --For every course, there are 40 course status to be set for the 40 DegIDs
     course status can be CORE(C) or, ELECTIVE(E) or, NONE(N) set by the Dean as the first Operation in each semester
   --Dean also enters the number of electives to be done by each DegID
   
2. Initial Registration in the IIT(Only for Autumn semester)
   Student enters details like name, registration number, address, password, deptt, degree
   A Roll number/StudentID is generated for the student as per the rules described above
    
	
3. Semester registration
   UserID : Roll Number(also called StudentID) 
   Password : "student"(by default else the one set at the time of initial registration)
   
   Displayed a set of his/her CORE courses and ELECTIVE courses as set by the the Dean
   Allowed to choose number of Electives to be done, this number was set by the Dean
   
4. Grade entry by the teacher
   UserID : TeacherID or, FacAdID(described above)
   Password : "teacher" or, "facad"
   
   Each teacher(Faculty Advisor(FacAd) or, Non-FacAd) teaches one or, zero courses
   List of Students under teacher's course is displayed, grades can be set for each student
		Note: Every time the teacher changes grade, result for each student affected is updated
			  Default grade = A
			  
5. Display of Result
   Asks for Roll Number and displays the most updated result including CGPA, SGPA, Total credits, Semester credits, Course Details and grades for current semester
   CGPA < 6 : Warning message printed
   CGPA >= 9 : Congratulatory message printed
 
6. Next Semester : Dean enters the Course Details, course status for each DegID and number of electives to be done for each DegID

   Semester Tailoring by Faculty Advisor
   UserID : FacAdID(described above)
   Password : "facad"
   
   Each Faculty Advisor has a batch of students, ex- FA1 has batch of first year deptt A students
   Displays the results and number of electives to be done for his/her batch students 
   The faculty adviser can reduce the number of electives of weak students (only for those having CGPA less then 7) on a case by case basis.

7. Then again follow from step 2.


Assumed Data :
40 Non-FacAd teachers are assumed, 10 for each deptt(A/B/C/D)
20 FacAds are assumed, one for each year(1/2/3/4/5) in deptt(A/B/C/D)
70 courses, 35 for each semester(further 9 each for deptt A,B,C and 8 for deptt C)
However, course details like name, LTPC, couurse status for each DegID is modifiable, and number of electives for each DegID is modifiable only by the Dean

--> Random Student Generation for Testing purpose : 
		Random students MUST be generated before registering any student manually
		Selecting this option generates 60 students(15 for each deptt, further 10 for B.Tech and 5 for Dual) for the current semester(iff Autumn Smester)
		i.e. does their initial registration(iff Autumn Smester),
		and does semester registration for all randomly students till then, for the current semester
